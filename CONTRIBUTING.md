- Include accessibility impact assessment
- Provide steps to reproduce for bugs

### 2. Branch Naming
- `feature/description` - New features
- `fix/issue-number` - Bug fixes
- `accessibility/description` - Accessibility improvements
- `test/description` - Test additions

### 3. Commit Messages
Follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): description

feat(search): add voice search capability
fix(navigation): resolve keyboard trap in modal
a11y(snippets): improve screen reader announcements
test(content): add Project Gutenberg test content
```

### 4. Pull Request Process
1. **Create PR** with descriptive title and detailed description
2. **Fill out PR template** including accessibility checklist
3. **Include tests** for new functionality
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Request review** from maintainers

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Mobile-first responsive design

### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements
- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Maintain logical heading hierarchy
- Provide alternative text for images

## Testing Guidelines

### Automated Tests
```bash
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:verbose  # Detailed output
npm run test:browser  # Interactive testing
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab through all controls
- [ ] **Screen Reader**: Test with assistive technology
- [ ] **High Contrast**: Verify visibility in high contrast mode
- [ ] **Zoom**: Test functionality at 200% zoom
- [ ] **Mobile**: Test touch accessibility

### Writing Tests
- Focus on user-visible functionality
- Include accessibility-specific test cases
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Document test purposes clearly

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Include JSDoc comments for all public functions
- Document accessibility features and requirements
- Explain complex accessibility implementations

### User Documentation
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include accessibility features in all guides
- Use inclusive language throughout

## Content Guidelines

### Adding Educational Content
Content should follow this structure:
```javascript
{
  title: "Document Title",
  author: "Author Name",
  sections: [
    {
      id: "section-id",
      title: "Section Title", 
      subsections: [
        {
          id: "subsection-id",
          title: "Subsection Title",
          content: "HTML content with semantic markup"
        }
      ]
    }

## Historical Context

Remember that NIBS continues the legacy of the original 1990s system that empowered students with motor disabilities to study independently. Every contribution should honor this mission by prioritizing accessibility and educational value.

*"The students wanted to be able to study independently, and this led to a two-year research programme, conducted between 1987 and 1989, into alternative solutions for meeting this need."* - Original NIBS paper

Thank you for helping to continue this important work!
